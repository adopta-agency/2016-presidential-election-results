<h1>2016 Presidential General Election Results</h1>
<p>I am very data oriented. I've worked as a data professional since 1987, and it is how I understand things. I'm not a believer in all things data, big data, and that it should drive everything we do, but I do feel it is an important tool in our toolbox. Especially during an election like we just experienced, where facts have seemed to become irrelevant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen a lot of people throw out numbers regarding the general election, with some claiming Trump won the popular vote, and others claiming Hilliary won the popular vote. If you Google for the results, you'll find the following numbers:</p>
<table width="100%">

<p>I would confidently say that Hilliary won the popular vote, but Donald Trump took the Electoral College according to these number. I still wanted to go to the horse's mouth (the states), see if I could pull their numbers, and put together my own data set, and learn something along the way--it is just the way I do things. I enjoy the process, and I enjoy what I learn along the way&nbsp;and any reinforcement of the knowledge that I gain. I wish this is something more people would do before making claims. At least Google it.</p>
<p>To seeded my work I started with <a href="http://www.electproject.org/2016g">the 2016&nbsp;United States Election Project</a>, because&nbsp;it provided me with the overall voter registration numbers, and links to "most" of the state elections page. I wasn't able to get the results directly from each page, as they did not provide them, and I just relied on Google for these. I will check back on these sites when I have time to update, as I saw some of them were still adding numbers.</p>
<p>Here are the results I have currently for the 2016 Presidential General&nbsp;Election in <a href="http://2016-election.adopta.agency/data/2016-November-General-Election-Turnout-Rates.xlsx">Excel</a>, <a href="http://2016-election.adopta.agency/data/2016-November-General-Election-Turnout-Rates.csv">CSV</a>, <a href="http://2016-election.adopta.agency/data/2016-November-General-Election-Turnout-Rates.json">JSON</a>, and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adopta-agency/2016-presidential-election-results/gh-pages/_data/results.yaml">YAML</a> formats. I'm using the YAML to drive the results below.</p>
